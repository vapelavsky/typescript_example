# typescript_example

This code defines TypeScript interfaces and constants related to a customizable classification table widget for a dashboard or similar UI (User Interface). Let's break down the different parts:

Interfaces:
IWidgetConfigCustomizableClassificationTable:

Extends IWidgetConfigGeneric, indicating it inherits properties common to all widget configurations but specifies that it uses a IWidgetTemplateCustomizableClassificationTable and identifies itself with a specific WIDGET_TYPE.
This interface represents the configuration settings specific to a customizable classification table widget.
IWidgetTemplateCustomizableClassificationTable:

Extends the base IWidgetTemplate interface, adding properties specific to the customizable classification table.
Includes settings for node selection, time periods, granularity, decimal places, row position, text box visibility, description, date format, and start of the calendar month.
ICustomizableClassificationTableModel:

Extends a base model for customizable models, specifically tailored for the customizable classification table type.
Contains properties defining the node selections that are specific to this widget type.
ICustomizableClassificationTablePropertyBag:

Defines a set of properties related to the customizable classification table's appearance and behavior such as time periods, granularity, decimal places, custom height, text box visibility, description, date format, y-row position, and start of the calendar month.
Constants:
VALID_CUSTOMIZABLE_CLASSIFICATION_TABLE_WIDGET_QUERY_RESULT:

A constant, an empty array as of now, but likely intended to hold a list of valid query results specific to the customizable classification table widget. Its empty state ([] as const) suggests that no query results are defined yet, or this serves as a placeholder.
ValidCustomizableClassificationTableWidgetQueryResult:

A type that represents the results obtained from querying the customizable classification table widget. It utilizes TypeScript's utility types to infer the correct type based on the contents of VALID_CUSTOMIZABLE_CLASSIFICATION_TABLE_WIDGET_QUERY_RESULT.
CUSTOMIZABLE_CLASSIFICATION_TABLE_WIDGET_TEMPLATE:

An immutable constant (likely leveraging a utility or library for immutability) that provides a template for creating a new customizable classification table widget configuration.
It outlines the default structure and settings for a new classification table widget, including widget ID, volatility, type, and various default settings for its appearance and behavior.
Overall, this code is part of a larger system dealing with configurable dashboard widgets, specifically focused on classification tables that can be customized by the user or the system. The code defines how the data structure of these widgets should be organized and how the different options and settings should be applied.
